    <title>PRD for Fitness application discussion</title>
    <executiveSummary>The Fitness application discussion project aims to develop a comprehensive fitness app that leverages AI-driven personalization, wearable device integration, virtual classes, nutrition tracking, social challenges, and mental health features to deliver a holistic user experience. Drawing from industry trends such as AI personalization, wearable compatibility, virtual fitness, and mental health integration, the app will incorporate best practices from competitors like Nike Training Club, MyFitnessPal, Strava, Peloton, and Fitbit. The MVP will focus on high-priority features to achieve business goals including improved user engagement, market share capture, monetization through subscriptions, and regulatory compliance, while adhering to constraints like a 9-month timeline and $5 million budget.</executiveSummary>
