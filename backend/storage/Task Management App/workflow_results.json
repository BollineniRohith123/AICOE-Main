Additionally, you will need to create the necessary CSS and JavaScript files to style and animate the HTML elements.\n\nHere is an example of what the CSS and JavaScript files might look like:\n\n**styles.css**\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n}\n\nheader {\n    background-color: #333;\n    color: #fff;\n    padding: 20px;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    font-size: 36px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\nh2 {\n    font-size: 24px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\nul {\n    list-style: none;\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n}\n\nli {\n    padding: 10px;\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;\n}\n\na {\n    text-decoration: none;\n    color: #337ab7;\n}\n\na:hover {\n    color: #23527c;\n}\n\nfooter {\n    background-color: #333;\n    color: #fff;\n    padding: 20px;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\nimg {\n    width: 100px;\n    height: 100px;\n    margin: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n**script.js**\n```javascript\n// Add event listeners to the use cases\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.use-case').forEach((useCase) => {\n    useCase.addEventListener('click', () => {\n        // Get the use case ID\n        const useCaseId = useCase.getAttribute('id');\n\n        // Get the use case details\n        const useCaseDetails = document.querySelector(`#uc-${useCaseId}`);\n\n        // Show the use case details\n        useCaseDetails.style.display = 'block';\n    });\n});\n\n// Add event listeners to the non-functional requirements\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.non-functional-requirement').forEach((requirement) => {\n    requirement.addEventListener('click', () => {\n        // Get the requirement ID\n        const requirementId = requirement.getAttribute('id');\n\n        // Get the requirement details\n        const requirementDetails = document.querySelector(`#nr-${requirementId}`);\n\n        // Show the requirement details\n        requirementDetails.style.display = 'block';\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example, and you will need to add more functionality and styles to make the HTML document fully functional.",
