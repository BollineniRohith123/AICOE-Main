Meeting Transcript - Task Management App

Date: November 1, 2025
Attendees: Product Manager, Tech Lead, UX Designer

Product Manager: Good morning everyone. Today we're going to discuss building a simple task management application. We need something clean and intuitive.

Tech Lead: Sounds good. What are the core features we're looking at?

Product Manager: Let's keep it simple for the MVP. We need:
1. User registration and login
2. Create, view, and manage tasks
3. Mark tasks as complete
4. Simple dashboard to see all tasks

UX Designer: I like the simplicity. For the user registration, should we include social login options?

Product Manager: No, let's keep it simple with email and password for now. We can add OAuth later.

Tech Lead: What about the task management? Any specific fields we need?

Product Manager: Each task should have:
- Title (required)
- Description (optional)
- Due date (optional)
- Priority level (Low, Medium, High)
- Status (To Do, In Progress, Done)

UX Designer: Should users be able to categorize tasks or add tags?

Product Manager: Not for MVP. Let's focus on the core functionality first.

Tech Lead: What about the dashboard? What should it show?

Product Manager: The dashboard should display:
- Total number of tasks
- Tasks by status (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Upcoming tasks (sorted by due date)
- Quick action to create a new task

UX Designer: Should we have any filtering or sorting options?

Product Manager: Yes, users should be able to:
- Filter by status
- Filter by priority
- Sort by due date or creation date

Tech Lead: Any specific technology preferences?

Product Manager: We want a modern web application. React for frontend, Node.js for backend, and MongoDB for database.

UX Designer: What about the design aesthetic?

Product Manager: Clean, modern, Apple-inspired design. Lots of white space, smooth animations, and intuitive interactions.

Tech Lead: Alright, so to summarize:
1. User authentication (email/password)
2. Task CRUD operations
3. Dashboard with statistics
4. Filtering and sorting

Product Manager: Exactly. Let's aim to have this ready in 4 weeks.

UX Designer: I'll start working on the mockups right away.

Tech Lead: I'll draft the technical architecture and API specifications.

Product Manager: Perfect. Let's reconvene next week to review progress.
